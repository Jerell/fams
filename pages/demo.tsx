				pressure than N3, so there is a pressure discontinuity at the end of
				pipe P0, which connects node N0 to node N1.

				Pipe P0 has been drawn in red because of this pressure discontinuity.

				Pressure values are only calculated on initialisation or when a pipe
				segment receives a new source or destination node. The pipes were
				created in the order shown below, which means the pressure at N2 is only
				calculated once, before N3 is connected to N1. N2 is unaware of the
				change that affected the pressure at N1, so the calculated pressure
				remains what it was when N1 was only connected to N0.
